abstract = {In the subantarctic fur seal Arctocephalus tropicalis, mothers leave their pups during the rearing period to make long and frequent feeding trips to sea. When a female returns from the ocean, she has to find her pup among several hundred others. Taking into account both spectral and temporal domains, we investigated the individual vocal signature occurring in the 'female attraction call' used by pups to attract their mother. We calculated the intra- and inter-individual variability for each measured acoustic cue to isolate those likely to contain information about individual identity. We then tested these cues in playback experiments. Our results show that a female pays particular attention to the lower part of the signal spectrum, the fundamental frequency accompanied by its first two harmonics being sufficient to elicit reliable recognition. The spectral energy distribution is also important for the recognition process. Of the temporal features, frequency modulation appears to be a key component for individual recognition, whereas amplitude modulation is not implicated in the identification of the pup's voice by its mother. We discuss these results with respect to the constraints imposed on fur seals by a colonial way of life.},

After repeatedly being played an intergroup call in the absence of other groups, vervets also ignored an acoustically different intergroup call given by the same individual. The monkeys did not transfer habituation, however, if the new call was given by a different individual. In tests where the referents of two calls were different, the monkeys also failed to transfer habituation across call types.

abstract = {The social intelligence hypothesis argues that competition and cooperation among individuals have shaped the evolution of cognition in animals. What do we mean by social cognition? Here we suggest that the building blocks of social cognition are a suite of skills, ordered roughly according to the cognitive demands they place upon individuals. These skills allow an animal to recognize others by various means; to recognize and remember other animals' relationships; and, perhaps, to attribute mental states to them. Some skills are elementary and virtually ubiquitous in the animal kingdom; others are more limited in their taxonomic distribution. We treat these skills as the targets of selection, and assume that more complex levels of social cognition evolve only when simpler methods are inadequate. As a result, more complex levels of social cognition indicate greater selective pressures in the past. The presence of each skill can be tested directly through field observations and experiments. In addition, the same methods that have been used to compare social cognition across species can also be used to measure individual differences within species and to test the hypothesis that individual differences in social cognition are linked to differences in reproductive success.},

A towed beam-forming array was used to ascribe stereotyped pulsed calls with two independently modulated frequency contours to visually identified individual killer whales in Johnstone Strait, British Columbia. Overall, call similarity determined using neural networks differed significantly between different affiliation levels for both frequency components of all the call types analysed. This method distinguished calls from individuals within the same matriline better than different calls produced by a single individual and better than by chance. The calls of individuals from different matrilines were more distinctive than those within the same matriline, confirming previous studies based on group recordings. These results show that frequency contours of stereotyped calls differ among the individuals that are constantly associated with each other and use group-specific vocalizations, though across-group differences were substantially more pronounced.},

In the Pacific, socially segregated, vocal clans with distinct dialects coexist; by contrast, geographical variation in vocal repertoire in the Atlantic has been attributed to drift. We examine networks of acoustic repertoire similarity and social interactions for 11 social units in the Eastern Caribbean. We find the presence of two socially segregated, sympatric vocal clans whose dialects differ significantly both in terms of categorical coda types produced by each clan (Mantel test between clans: matrix correlation=0.256; p ≤ 0.001) and when using classificationfree similarity which ignores defined types (Mantel test between clans: matrix correlation=0.180; p ≤ 0.001). The more common of the two clans makes a characteristic 1+1+3 coda, while the other less often sighted clan makes predominantly regular codas. Units were only observed associating with other units within their vocal clan. This study demonstrates that sympatric vocal clans do exist in the Atlantic, that they define a higher order level of social organization as they do in the Pacific, and suggests that cultural identity at the clan level is probably important in this species worldwide.},

In these cases, there might be selection pressures for the development of identity signals and mechanisms that allow discrimination and recognition of particular individuals. Female sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, live in long-term, stable social units. Differential interactions among unit members suggest the need for an individual discrimination system. Sperm whales produce stereotyped series of click sounds called codas, which are thought to be used for communication. Although codas were initially proposed as individual signatures, later studies did not support this hypothesis. Using linear discriminant functions and Mantel tests, we tested variation within coda types as a means for individual identification, using recordings where codas were assigned to individual whales. While most coda types showed no indication of individual-specific information, individual differences that were robust to variation among recording days were found in the 5 Regular coda type. Differences in individual-specific information between coda types suggest that different coda types may have distinct functions. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Loud, long-distance calls serve varied functions across animal species including marking territory, attracting mates and signalling one's identity. Here, we examined the types of sender- and context-specific information encoded in the howls of captive timber wolves, Canis lupus. We analysed 913 howls from nine individuals across three packs and investigated whether howl structure varied consistently as a function of phenotypic factors (age class, sex, pack and identity of the caller) in addition to the context in which the call was produced: specifically, whether the call was produced in a 'spontaneous' context just after sunrise or was ‘elicited' by the absence of a group member. Calls were correctly classified by individual identity and production context, but not by any other factors. Principal components analyses indicated that individual differences were primarily associated with frequency-based measures, whereas acoustic variation between production contexts was associated with a variety of frequency-, intensity- and energy-based measures. Recognition of individual differences in vocalizations is likely to be important for navigating social relationships in wolves and further work is required to determine which life history factors may shape these individual differences. Differences resulting from production context are suggestive that these howl variants may serve different functions. The extent to which these individual and contextual differences are understood by receivers remains an open question.},

In many species, members of one sex dominate those of the other in one-on-one interactions. Whether this results from a disparity in intrinsic attributes, such as strength and aggressiveness, or in extrinsic factors, such as social support, is currently unknown. We assessed the effects of both mechanisms on dominance in the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), a species where sexual size dimorphism is low and females often dominate males. We found that individuals with greater potential social support dominated one-on-one interactions in all social contexts, irrespective of their body mass and sex. Female dominance emerged from a disparity in social support in favour of females. This disparity was a direct consequence of male-biased dispersal and the disruptive effect of dispersal on social bonds. Accordingly, the degree of female dominance varied with the demographic and kin structure of the social groups, ranging from male and female co-dominance to complete female dominance. Our study shows that social support can drive sex-biased dominance and provides empirical evidence that a sex-role-defining trait can emerge without the direct effect of sex.},

In oscine songbirds, where learned song is most prevalent, it is used primarily for intrasexual selection and mate attraction. Learning of a different class of vocal signals, known as contact calls, is found in a diverse array of species, where they are used to mediate social interactions among individuals. We argue that call learning provides a taxonomically rich system for studying testable hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of vocal learning. We describe and critically evaluate four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin and current function of vocal learning of calls, which propose that call learning (1) improves auditory detection and recognition, (2) signals local knowledge, (3) signals group membership, or (4) allows for the encoding of more complex social information. We propose approaches to testing these four hypotheses but emphasize that all of them share the idea that social living, not sexual selection, is a central driver of vocal learning. Finally, we identify future areas for research on call learning that could provide new perspectives on the origins and mechanisms of vocal learning in both animals and humans.},

abstract = {Despite longstanding interest in the evolutionary origins and maintenance of vocal learning, we know relatively little about how social dynamics influence vocal learning processes in natural populations. The “signaling group membership” hypothesis proposes that socially learned calls evolved and are maintained as signals of group membership. However, in fission–fusion societies, individuals can interact in social groups across various social scales. For learned calls to signal group membership over multiple social scales, they must contain information about group membership over each of these scales, a concept termed “hierarchical mapping.” Monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), small parrots native to South America, exhibit vocal mimicry in captivity and fission–fusion social dynamics in the wild. We examined patterns of contact call acoustic similarity in Uruguay to test the hierarchical mapping assumption of the signaling group membership hypothesis. We also asked whether geographic variation patterns matched regional dialects or geographic clines that have been documented in other vocal learning species. We used visual inspection, spectrographic cross-correlation and random forests, a machine learning approach, to evaluate contact call similarity. We compared acoustic similarity across social scales and geographic distance using Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation. We found high similarity within individuals, and low, albeit significant, similarity within groups at the pair, flock and site social scales. Patterns of acoustic similarity over geographic distance did not match mosaic or graded patterns expected in dialectal or clinal variation. Our findings suggest that monk parakeet social interactions rely more heavily upon individual recognition than group membership at higher social scales.},

abstract = {We develop an evolutionary model that predicts that characters selected to signal individual identity will have properties differing from those expected for indicator signals of quality. Traits signaling identity should be highly variable, often display polymodal distributions, not be condition dependent (i.e., be cheap to produce and/or maintain), not be associated with fitness differences, exhibit independent assortment of component characters, and often occur as fixed phenotypes with a high degree of genetic determination. We illustrate the existence of traits with precisely these attributes in the ornamental, conspicuously variable, and sexually dimorphic breeding plumages of ruff sandpipers Philomachus pugnax and red-billed queleas Quelea quelea. Although ruffs lek and queleas are monogamous, both species breed in high-density aggregations with high rates of social interactions (e.g., aggression and territory defense). Under these socioecological conditions, individual recognition based on visual cues may be unusually important. In contrast to these species, we also review plumage characteristics in house finches Carpodacus mexicanus, a nonterritorial, dispersed-breeding species in which plumage ornamentation is thought to signal quality. In keeping with expectations for quality signals, house finch plumage is relatively less variable, unimodally distributed, condition dependent, correlated with fitness measures, has positively correlated component characters, and is a plastic, environmentally determined trait. We briefly discuss signals of identity in other animals.},

abstract = {Objective The purpose of this study is to establish normative values for the smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS) and its sensitivity and specificity as a measure of dysphonia. Study Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Voice samples of running speech were obtained from 835 patients and 50 volunteers. Eight laryngologists and four speech-language pathologists performed perceptual ratings of the voice samples on the degree of dysphonia/normality using an analog scale. The mean of their perceptual ratings was used as the gold standard for the detection of the presence or absence of dysphonia. CPPS was measured using the CPPS algorithm of Hillenbrand, and the cut-off value for positivity that has the highest sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between normal and severely dysphonia voices was determined based on ROC-curve analysis. Results The cut-off value for normal for CPPS was set at 4.0 or higher, which gave a sensitivity of 92.4%, a specificity of 79%, a positive predictive value of 82.5%, and a negative predictive value of 90.8%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.937 (P < 0.05). Conclusions CPPS is a good measure of dysphonia, with the normal value of CPPS (Hillenbrand algorithm) of a running speech sample being defined as a value of 4.0 or higher.},

abstract = {Vocal learning is well known among passerine and psittacine birds, but most data on mammals are equivocal. Specific benefits of vocal learning are poorly understood for most species. One case where vocal learning should be favoured by selection is where calls indicate group membership and group mates are unrelated. Female greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, live in stable groups of unrelated bats and use loud, broadband calls to coordinate foraging movements of social group mates. Bats benefit from group foraging. Calls differ between female social groups and cave colonies, and playback experiments demonstrate that bats perceive these acoustic differences. Here I show that the group distinctive structure of calls arises through vocal learning. Females change call structure when group composition changes, resulting in increased similarity among new social group mates. Comparisons of transfers with age-matched half-sibs indicate that call changes are not simply due to maturation, the physical environment or heredity. These results suggest that studies testing vocal learning in mammals could profit by focusing on vocalizations that signify group membership.},

abstract = {Many marine animals use sound passively or actively for communication, foraging, predator avoidance, navigation, and to sense their environment. The advent of acoustic recording tags has allowed biologists to get the on-animal perspective of the sonic environment and, in combination with movement sensors, to relate sounds to the activities of the tagged animal. These powerful tools have led to a wide range of insights into the behaviour of marine animals and have opened new opportunities for studying the ways they interact with their environment. Acoustic tags demand new analysis methods and careful experimental design to optimize the consistency between research objectives and the realistic performance of the tags. Technical details to consider are the suitability of the tag attachment to a given species, the accuracy of the tag sensors, and the recording and attachment duration of the tag. Here we consider the achievements, potential, and limitations of acoustic recording tags in studying the behaviour, habitat use and sensory ecology of marine mammals, the taxon to which this technology has been most often applied. We examine the application of acoustic tags to studies of vocal behaviour, foraging ecology, acoustic tracking, and the effects of noise to assess both the breadth of applications and the specific issues that arise in each. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {Recollection-based recognition memory judgments benefit greatly from effortful elaborative encoding, whereas familiarity-based judgments are much less sensitive to such manipulations. In this study, we have examined whether rote rehearsal under divided attention might produce the opposite dissociation, benefiting familiarity more than recollection. Subjects rehearsed word pairs during the "distractor" phase of a working memory span task, and were then given a surprise memory test for the distractor items at the end of the experiment. Experiment 1 demonstrated that increasing rehearsal elevated the recognition rate for intact and rearranged pairs, but neither associative recognition accuracy nor implicit fragment completion benefited from rehearsal. The results suggest that rote rehearsal leads to a greater increase in familiarity than in recollection, and that the increase in observed familiarity cannot be attributed to effects of repetition priming. In Experiment 2, we tested item recognition with the remember/know procedure, and the results supported the conclusions of Experiment 1. Moreover, a signal detection model of remember/know performance systematically overpredicted rehearsal increases in remember rates, and this worsened when high-rehearsal items were assumed to be more variable in strength. The results suggest that rote rehearsal can dissociate familiarity from recollection at the time of encoding and that item recognition cannot be fully accommodated within a one-dimensional signal detection model.},

A formal dual-process theory of recognition memory that accounts for the word-frequency mirror effect is extended to account for the list-length and strength-based mirror effects. According to this theory, the hit portions of these mirror effects result from differential ease of recollection-based recognition, and the false alarm portions result from differential reliance on familiarity-based recognition. This account yields predictions for participants' Remember and Know responses as a function of list length and encoding strength. Empirical data and model fits from four experiments support these predictions. The data also demonstrate a reliable list-length effect when several potential confounding factors are controlled, contributing to the debate regarding the effect of list length on recognition. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than 30 northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per deployment. Several deployments have included sound playbacks to the tagged whale and a transient response to at least one playback is evident in the tag data.},

abstract = {In colonial species, recognition of offspring should be under strong selection. For accurate identification to occur offspring must emit individually distinctive signals and parents must be able to discriminate between signals. Female greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus) roost in stable social groups and use infant vocalizations, termed isolation calls, to locate and identify their young. In this study, we investigate both the production and perception of isolation calls in P. hastatus. First, we measured acoustic features and found that after controlling for ontogenetic effects, sufficient variation exists between pups for isolation calls to function as individual signatures. Moreover, pups from the same social group emit calls with more similar spectral and spectro-temporal features than pups from different social groups, indicating that these features are likely heritable. We used psychoacoustic experiments in the laboratory to determine if adult females could discriminate between calls from pups in the same or different social group. Females discriminated between pups when faced with a template-matching task and their performance was correlated with the salience of spectral and spectro-temporal features. We found no difference in performance when females had to discriminate between pups from the same and different social groups. These results indicate that females should be able to accurately identify their young using isolation calls.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that long-range songs of birds and primates are structurally adapted to local habitat acoustics. The evolution of frog calls, however, seems to be less influenced by habitat. Frogs are extremely dependent on energetically costly acoustic signals, which frequently have to be transmitted over large distances to elicit an encounter with the opposite sex. Different acoustic properties of advertisement calls from 95 Bolivian anuran species were analyzed according to their taxonomic position and the habitat characteristics where each species occurred. The majority of call characteristics, such as diversity of notes, number of pulses per note, or dominant frequency, appear strongly related to taxonomic position. Large-scale habitat characteristics (ecoregion and macrohabitat type) were not related to call characteristics, whereas small-scale habitat (microhabitat) complexity appeared to explain some of the variation in dominant frequency modulation. Species that call in closed microhabitats are more likely to use frequency-modulated calls, which may allow for more efficient sound transmission. To further the understanding of frog-call evolution in response to habitat selection, this and other studies have indicated that studies at finer spatial scales are needed, as well as additional studies restricted to the genus or species level.},

abstract = {The field of animal vocal communication has benefited greatly from improved understanding of vocal production mechanisms and specifically from the generalization of the source-filter theory of speech production to non-human mammals. The application of the source-filter theory has enabled researchers to decompose the acoustic structure of vocal signals according to their mode of production and thereby to predict the acoustic variation that is caused by anatomical or physiological attributes of the caller. The source-filter theory states that vocal signals result from a two-stage production, with the glottal wave generated in the larynx (the source), being subsequently filtered in the supralaryngeal vocal tract (the filter). This theory predicts that independent indexical information such as body size, weight, age and sex can be contained in both the glottal wave (mostly characterized by its fundamental frequency), and the spectral envelope of the radiated vocalization (mostly characterized by the vocal tract resonances or formant frequencies). Additionally, physiological fluctuations in emotional or motivational state have been found to influence the acoustic characteristics of signals in a reliable and predictable manner that is perceptually available to receivers. While animal vocalizations contain some dynamic attributes, their static attributes are sufficient to provide an effective means of acoustic individual discrimination both within and across call types. In this paper, we draw together a wealth of experimental work conducted within the source-filter framework over the last decade and we review how such experiments have elucidated the communicative value of animal vocalizations. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {The sound-producing structure in birds is the syrinx, which is usually a two-part organ located at the junction of the bronchi. As each branch of the syrinx produces sound independently, many birds have two acoustic sources. Thirty years ago, we had anatomical, physiological and acoustical evidence of this two-voice phenomenon but no function was known. In songbirds, often these two voices with their respective harmonics are not activated simultaneously but they are obvious in large penguins and generate a beat pattern which varies between individuals. The emperor penguin breeds during the Antarctic winter, incubating and carrying its egg on its feet. Without the topographical cue of a nest, birds identify each other only by vocal means when switching duties during incubation or chick rearing. To test whether the two-voice system contains the identity code, we played back the modified call of their mate to both adults and also the modified call of their parents to chicks. Both the adults and the chicks replied to controls (two voices) but not to modified signals (one voice being experimentally suppressed). Our experiments demonstrate that the beat generated by the interaction of these two fundamental frequencies conveys information about individual identity and also propagates well through obstacles, being robust to sound degradation through the medium of bodies in a penguin colony. The two-voice structure is also clear in the call of other birds such as the king penguin, another non-nesting species, but not in the 14 other nesting penguins. We concluded that the two-voice phenomenon functions as an individual recognition system in species using few if any landmarks to meet. In penguins, this coding process, increasing the call complexity and resisting sound degradation, has evolved in parallel with the loss of territoriality.},

abstract = {The acoustic environment, composed in part by the vocalizations of sympatric animals, is a major source of information and can be used to fine-tune behavioural decisions. Active assessment of alarm calls within and between mammal species is not fully understood. We explored the behavioural responses of collared pikas to con- and heterospecific vocalizations, in order to determine whether they selectively attend to these calls. Pikas increased their vigilance after playback of alarm calls of heterospecific mammals (marmots and ground squirrels), but responded most strongly to conspecific calls. While responses to playback calls of their own, of neighbours and of a stranger did not differ, pikas did discriminate between individual callers in a habituation-discrimination experiment. The ability to make use of information from different sources in their acoustic environment likely facilitates pikas' behavioural decisions that affect foraging, predator avoidance and nepotism},

abstract = {Individual vocal recognition plays an important role in the social lives of many vocally active species. In group-living songbirds the most common vocalizations during communal interactions are low-intensity, soft, unlearned calls. Being able to tell individuals apart solely from a short call would allow a sender to choose a specific group member to address, resulting in the possibility to form complex communication networks. However, little research has yet been carried out to discover whether soft calls contain individual identity. In this study, males and females of zebra finch pairs were tested with six vocalization types - four different soft calls, the distance call and the male song - to investigate whether they are able to distinguish individuals of the opposite sex. For both sexes, we provide the first evidence of individual vocal recognition for a zebra finch soft unlearned call. Moreover, while controlling for habituation and testing for repeatability of the findings, we quantify the effects of hitherto little studied variables such as partners' vocal exchange previous to the experiment, spectral content of playback calls and quality of the answers. We suggest that zebra finches can recognize individuals via soft vocalizations, therefore allowing complex directed communication within vocalizing flocks.},

abstract = {Theoretically intelligence should evolve to help animals solve specific types of problems posed by the environment, but it remains unclear how environmental complexity or novelty facilitates the evolutionary enhancement of cognitive abilities, or whether domain-general intelligence can evolve in response to domain-specific selection pressures. The social complexity hypothesis, which posits that intelligence evolved to cope with the labile behaviour of conspecific group-mates, has been strongly supported by work on the sociocognitive abilities of primates and other animals. Here we review the remarkable convergence in social complexity between cercopithecine primates and spotted hyaenas, and describe our tests of predictions of the social complexity hypothesis in regard to both cognition and brain size in hyaenas. Behavioural data indicate that there has been remarkable convergence between primates and hyaenas with respect to their abilities in the domain of social cognition. Furthermore, within the family Hyaenidae, our data suggest that social complexity might have contributed to enlargement of the frontal cortex. However, social complexity failed to predict either brain volume or frontal cortex volume in a larger array of mammalian carnivores. To address the question of whether or not social complexity might be able to explain the evolution of domain-general intelligence as well as social cognition in particular, we presented simple puzzle boxes, baited with food and scaled to accommodate body size, to members of 39 carnivore species housed in zoos and found that species with larger brains relative to their body mass were more innovative and more successful at opening the boxes. However, social complexity failed to predict success in solving this problem. Overall our work suggests that, although social complexity enhances social cognition, there are no unambiguous causal links between social complexity and either brain size or performance in problem-solving tasks outside the social domain in mammalian carnivores.},

abstract = {The function of social calls emitted by foraging bats has received little study. Here we use observations of free-ranging greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, and field playbacks to determine whether audible, broad-band 'screech' calls attract mates, warn conspecifics or influence access to food. Five lines of evidence suggest that screech calls enable adult females from the same roosting group to fly together from the day roost to feeding sites. (1) Seasonal differences in diet influenced the rate of screech calling recorded outside the cave roost, as well as how often bats departed together. Bats called more often and flew in larger groups when feeding on a concentrated resource, balsa, Ochroma lagopus, flowers, in winter than on more dispersed Cecropia peltata fruit in spring. (2) Observations of bats flying outside the cave, in flyways and at feeding sites indicated that screech calls occurred more often when bats flew in groups than alone. (3) Females from the same roosting group were netted at the same feeding site, sometimes simultaneously, several kilometres from the cave. (4) Calling colour-marked adult females outside the cave were joined by a female group member, both on initial departures and on second foraging trips, more often than non-calling bats. (5) Playbacks attracted conspecifics at roost and feeding sites. Screech calls appear to function as contact calls that recruit and coordinate foraging among group members. We postulate that females benefit from foraging with unrelated roost-mates because they can defend feeding sites more effectively. Copyright 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Adaptive behaviour relies upon accurate estimation of relevant ecological parameters; the better informed an individual, the better it can develop and adjust its behaviour to meet the demands of a variable world. Here, we focus on the burgeoning interest in the impact of ecological uncertainty on adaptation, and the means by which it can be reduced by gathering information, from both 'passive' and 'responsive' sources. Our overview demonstrates the value of adopting an explicitly informational approach, and highlights the components that one needs to develop useful approaches to studying information use by animals. We propose a quantitative framework, based on statistical decision theory, for analysing animal information use in evolutionary ecology. Our purpose is to promote an integrative approach to studying information use by animals, which is itself integral to adaptive animal behaviour and organismal biology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Individually distinctive vocalizations are ubi- quitous; however, group distinctive calls have rarely been demonstrated. Under some conditions, selection should favor calls indicating social group membership in animals that forage in groups. Greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus) give calls that appear to facil- itate recognition of social group mates who are un- related. Females give loud broadband (4–18 kHz) vo- calizations termed screech calls when departing on foraging trips and at foraging sites. Screech calls help to establish foraging groups among social group members, and to maintain contact over the long distances they travel while foraging. I test two hypotheses about how screech calls may be structured to convey caller identity. Individual calls may be distinct and group members may learn to recognize each individual's calls and to associate the individual with the social group. Alternatively, groups may give distinct calls and individuals within groups may share call characteristics. To test these hy- potheses I conducted multivariate acoustic analysis of multiple calls from 28 bats from three social groups. Although the ubiquity of individually distinctive calls in other taxa makes this result more likely, the results re- veal that group calls are highly distinctive. Individual bats within groups are statistically indistinguishable. Calls appear to decrease slightly in frequency as bats age. Call convergence among unrelated group mates implies vocal learning in this species.},

abstract = {Fighting can be extremely costly in terms of energy use and potential for injury or death. Therefore, the ability to accurately assess a threat is advantageous, allowing an animal to retreat from conflict if its chances of winning are low. Game-theoretical models of agonistic behavior suggest that animals should base decisions about conflict escalation on an assessment of their opponent's fighting ability or resource-holding potential (RHP). Individuals can assess an opponent's fighting ability relative to their own using a number of physical and behavioral cues. Some aggressive displays, including some vocalizations, are believed to function as such cues, or advertisement displays, of an animal's RHP. Studies of advertisement displays have typically focused on contests between individuals. However, just as correct assessment of a rival is advantageous in conflict- escalation decisions between individuals, it might be expected that correct assessment of group size would be an important criterion in determining potential costs in contests between groups. Social animals would benefit from accurate perception of group size when assessing the fighting ability or RHP of a competing group in the same way that individual competitors benefit from assessment of their single competitor's size and strength.A number of studies have been published in recent years investigating group-level assessment in agonistic contests. These studies have focused on territorial vocal signals of various group-living species to determine whether competing groups glean information about group size from these acoustic signals and adjust their behavior in a manner consistent with the predictions of game-theoretical models of agonistic behavior. The goal of this thesis research was to determine whether group-size information is available in the group yip-howl of the coyote. The approach to this investigation was two-fold: a) conduct a field experiment with radio-collared coyotes and measure their movement and vocal responses to playbacks of group yip-howl recordings from different- sized groups, and b) analyze the acoustic features of the coyote group yip-howl. The aim of the field playback experiment was to measure the responses of coyotes to the agonistic vocalizations of a potential competing group. Acoustic features of the coyote group yip- howl were analyzed to better understand the potential cues contained in the signal that might allow for the perception of group size.},

abstract = {In the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), both pair members alternate in incubating and rearing their chick. Mates can recognize each other among thousands of other birds in the hubbub of the colony using only acoustic signalling - the display call. Large penguin colonies are found on sub-Antarctic islands where strong winds blow throughout the year. We have shown by experiments under natural conditions that the level of background noise increases in windy conditions and thus leads to a diminution of the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover the emergence level of the signal revealed by entropy calculation is statistically weaker in windy conditions. To achieve breeding success, birds must continue communicating in spite of the significant decrease in the total amount of information that can be transmitted in windy situations. For the first time, to our knowledge, we have shown that a bird species takes into account the constraints imposed by wind on their acoustic communication. In windy conditions, birds try to maintain the efficiency of communication by increasing both the number of calls emitted and the number of syllables per call. This result conforms with predictions from the mathematical theory of communication: increased redundancy in a signal improves the probability of receiving a message in a noisy channel.},

abstract = {Individuals often benefit from identifying their prospective social partners. Some species that live in stable social groups discriminate between their group mates and others, basing this distinction on calls that differ among individuals. Vocalizations that differ between social groups are much less common, and few studies have demonstrated that animals use group-distinctive calls to identify group mates. Female greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, live in stable groups of unrelated bats and give audible frequency, broadband calls termed screech calls when departing from the roost and at foraging sites. Previous field observations suggested that bats give screech calls to coordinate movements among group members. Prior acoustic analyses of 12 acoustic variables found group differences but not individual differences. Here, we use the same acoustic variables to compare calls from three cave colonies, and find that calls differ between caves. We also report results from field and laboratory playback experiments designed to test whether bats use acoustic differences to discriminate calls from different colonies, groups or individuals. Results from field playbacks indicate that response depends on the cave of origin, indicating that bats can discriminate among calls from different caves. This discrimination ability may be based, in part, on whether calls are familiar or unfamiliar to the listening bats. Laboratory playbacks demonstrate that bats discriminate calls given by their group mates from calls given by other bats from the same cave irrespective of familiarity. However, these experiments provide no evidence that bats discriminate among individuals. Previous field work indicates that females that forage with social group mates may benefit from shared information about food or mutual defence of feeding sites. Indicating group membership is essential, since these benefits appear to be restricted to group mates. Copyright 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

This interest has culminated in the production of the present special issue on multimodal communication, which features both theoretical and empirical studies from leading researchers in the field. Reviews, comparative analyses, and species-specific empirical studies include manuscripts on taxa as diverse as spiders, primates, birds, lizards, frogs, and humans. The present manuscript serves as both an introduction to this special issue, as well as an introduction to multimodal communication more generally. We discuss the history of the study of complexity in animal communication, issues relating to defining and classifying multimodal signals, and particular issues to consider with multimodal (as opposed to multicomponent unimodal) communication. We go on to discuss the current state of the field, and outline the contributions contained within the issue. We finish by discussing future avenues for research, in particular emphasizing that ‘multimodal' is more than just ‘bimodal', and that more integrative frameworks are needed that incorporate more elements of efficacy, such as receiver sensory ecology and the environment.},

We show here that, while traits associated with social complexity of the first kind occur in social mammals that live in groups composed of close relatives, traits associated with the complexity of social relationships occur where average kinship between female group members is low. These differences in the form of social complexity appear to be associated with variation in brain size and probably reflect contrasts in the extent of conflicts of interest between group members. Our results emphasise the limitations of any unitary concept of social complexity and show that variation in average kinship between group members has far-reaching consequences for animal societies.},

abstract = {In this review, we place equal emphasis on production, usage, and comprehension because these components of communication may exhibit different developmental trajectories and be affected by different neural mechanisms. In the animal kingdom generally, learned, flexible vocal production is rare, appearing in only a few orders of birds and few species of mammals. Compared with humans, the majority of species produce a limited repertoire of calls that show little modification during development. Call usage is also highly constrained. Unlike humans, most animals use specific call types only in a limited range of contexts. In marked contrast to production and usage, animals' comprehension of vocalizations, as measured by their responses, are highly flexible, modifiable as a result of experience, and show the most parallels with human language. The differences among vocal production, usage, and comprehension create an oddly asymmetric system of communication in which a small repertoire of relatively fixed calls, each linked to a particular context, can nonetheless give rise to an open-ended, highly modifiable, and cognitively rich set of meanings. Recent studies of baboons and eavesdropping songbirds provide two examples.},

These stages represented the approximate periods of residence of offspring at the communal den, from 1 to 8 months of age, between leaving the communal den and weaning, from 8 to 14 months, and between weaning and reproductive maturity or dispersal, from 14 to 36 months of age. Mean association indices among adult female dyads varied with social rank, with the highest mean association index observed for the alpha female. Adult females associated more closely with their adult female kin than with unrelated adult females. Female kin from high-ranking matrilines associated more closely than did kin from lower-ranking matrilines. Within mother-offspring pairs, association patterns were strongly influenced by the mother's social rank during all three stages of development of offspring, with high-ranking mother-offspring dyads associating more tightly than low ranking dyads at each stage. Mean mother-offspring association indices declined as offspring grew older, but we found no significant differences based on sex of offspring during any of the developmental stages examined.},

abstract = {Studies on captive bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, have shown that each individual produces a stereotyped, individually specific signature whistle; however, no study has demonstrated clear context-dependent usage of these whistles. Thus, the hypothesis that signature whistles are used to maintain group cohesion remains untested. To investigate whether signature whistles are used only in contexts that would require a mechanism to maintain group cohesion, we examined whistle type usage in a group of four captive bottlenose dolphins in two contexts. Individuals were recorded while they were separate from the group and while they all swam in the same pool. Separations occurred spontaneously when one animal swam into another pool. No partitions were used and no aggressive interactions between dolphins preceded separations. Calling animals were identified by an amplitude comparison of the same sound recorded in the two pools. Each dolphin primarily produced one stereotyped signature whistle when it was separated from the group. Similarly the remaining group in the other pool also used primarily their signature whistles if one animal was in a separate pool. If all animals swam in the same pool almost only nonsignature whistles were used. Signature whistle copying was rare and did not initiate reunions or specific vocal responses. The results strongly support the hypothesis that signature whistles are used to maintain group cohesion. Copyright 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Many of the mechanisms advanced to explain the evolution of intraspecific cooperative behaviour, such as reciprocity or social prestige, hinge on an animal's ability to recognize individual group members. However, 'true' individual recognition, between adult group members, has never been demonstrated in a cooperatively breeding bird or mammal species. We tested whether a wild cooperative mammal, the dwarf mongoose, Helogale parvula, could recognize individual group members from their vocalizations. We provided test subjects with a large, desirable food item and then simulated the approach of another group member using playbacks of its contact calls. Mongooses were more vigilant after hearing the calls of individuals of higher rank than themselves (that could steal their food) compared with individuals of lower rank than themselves (that could not). We showed that the mongooses were not simply responding to age-related cues that conveyed potential information on rank, and provide some evidence that they were associating the unique characteristics of the call with an individually specific characteristic of the caller (i.e. its relative rank). We conclude that dwarf mongooses exhibit 'true' individual recognition, and this finding supports the potential validity of mechanisms that rely on individuals monitoring the behaviour of others to explain the evolution of cooperative behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {In many cooperative animal societies, individuals can recognize their relatives and preferentially direct helping behaviors towards them. However, the ability to learn kin recognition cues may be constrained in societies with low relatedness, since group membership alone is not a reliable proxy for kinship. Here, we examine kin discrimination in the greater ani (Crotophaga major), a communally nesting bird in which several unrelated males and females reproduce in a single, shared nest and provide parental care to the mixed clutch of young. Each adult, therefore, is closely related to some nestlings in the clutch and unrelated to others. Food is limited and starvation is a significant cause of nestling mortality, suggesting that adults should increase their fitness by preferentially feeding their own offspring in the mixed clutch. To test this hypothesis, we cross-fostered broods of nestlings between pairs of nests, such that none of the nestlings in the manipulated nests were related to any of the adults feeding them. We found no evidence that adult greater anis discriminate between their own and unrelated nestlings: adults at cross-fostered groups fed nestlings at the same rates as adults at control (sham-manipulated) nests, and rates of nestling starvation were equal at cross-fostered and control nests. These results suggest that adult greater anis do not recognize their own nestlings, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that genetically encoded markers for kin recognition are rare in birds.},

abstract = {Unlike individually distinctive territorial calls, contact calls, or calls that aid in the recognition of young by their parents, the function or functions of individually distinctive alarm calls (vocalizations produced in response to predators) is not immediately apparent. Yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, ground-dwelling sciurid rodents, produce individually distinctive alarm calls. Using an habituation-recovery playback protocol, we show that marmots can perceive differences between the calls of different adult females. We further show that marmots are able to discriminate between at least one broad age-sex category. In contrast to what has been reported in other species, playback of calls from juveniles elicited a greater response (i.e. marmots increased vigilance and suppressed foraging) than did playback of calls from adult females. No other age-sex category led to responses significantly different from adult females. Future studies will seek to understand why individual discriminative abilities exist, but we have shown that individuals are able to identify when young, and presumably vulnerable, marmots are calling, and to respond by engaging in vigilance. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {In long-range fission-fusion complex societies, individuals are often recognized by audiovocal signals because of long-range propagation. The signature voice system is a well-known mechanism involving both acoustic individuality of a certain call type and discrimination ability. Previous studies on vocal individual recognition of birds have emphasized its involvement in breeding contexts such as mate, parent and offspring, and territorial-neighbour recognition. However, there has been less focus on the recognition of non-breeding flock members despite the socio-ecological demand of such ability in the complex social lives of highly social birds including corvids. Here we report a signature voice system in jungle crows by showing both acoustic individuality of contact calls and discrimination ability. We first performed a discriminant functional analysis on contact ka calls of five crows to examine their discriminatory potential and demonstrate inter-individual distinctions. We next used an operant conditioning to verify the perceptual ability to discriminate non-breeding familiar conspecifics based on ka calls. Four of the five crows successfully transferred discrimination of individual calls to the novel ka calls. Our results provide the first evidence of a signature voice system as a perceptual mechanism for individual recognition of familiar individuals in non-breeding flocks of a highly social crow. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

The duration of each sample increased in seven steps from 0.25 s up to a maximum of 2 s. Voice recognition improvements with stimulus duration were with a growth function. Gains were most rapid within the first second and less pronounced thereafter. When participants were unable to name a famous voice, they were cued with either a second voice sample, the occupation, or the initials of the celebrity. Initials were most effective the name only when semantic information about the speaker had been accessed prior to cue presentation. Paralleling previous research on face naming, this may indicate that voice naming is contingent on previous activation of person-specific semantic information.},

We integrate model testing with correlation-based phenotype networks to infer the contributions of female mate choice and male-male competition to the evolution of barn swallow communication. Overall, the best predictors of mate choice were distinct from those for competition, while moderate functional overlap suggests males and females use some of the same traits to assess potential mates and rivals. We interpret model results in the context of a network of traits, and suggest this approach allows researchers a more nuanced view of trait clustering patterns that informs new hypotheses about the evolution of communication systems.},

abstract = {Research on insect hearing and acoustic communication has made enormous progress in the twentieth century. Following the first descriptions of auditory organs behavioural studies pointed to the importance of insect hearing for intraspecific acoustic communication, predator avoidance and prey detection. Analysing the neural mechanisms underlying auditory processing and the motor activity for acoustic signalling in a variety of species has provided us with a deep functional understanding of this insect behaviour. As questions of central biological importance are exemplified in Insect Hearing and Acoustic Communication these will drive the current and future research. The sounds of singing and chirping insects are a salient feature of summer meadows, Mediterranean olive groves or tropical rain forests and have always caught the attention of naturalists and scientists. The evolution of insect ears has been driven by sexual and by natural selection in the context of intraspecific communication and by predator avoidance and prey detection. Ears have evolved in a variety of body regions, and evolved many times in parallel. The functional significance of insect acoustic signals and hearing organs, however, has only become evident over time. When Pumphrey (1940) wrote the first comprehensive review on “Hearing in Insects”, he began his conclusions with “The present time is perhaps a happy one for reviewing the experimental findings on the physiology of audition in insects in relation to their behaviour”. For Pumphrey, due to the earlier first detailed anatomical descriptions of hearing organs in different groups of insects, for example by Schwabe (1906) and Eggers (1911), and the demonstration that female crickets are attracted to the acoustic signals of a male calling song broadcast by a telephone receiver (Regen 1913), it became obvious that sound production and the sense of hearing played a crucial role in insect behaviour. The development of suitable electronic equipment allowed the field to progress rapidly, as indicated by the following key papers: The first electrophysiological recordings of auditory nerve activity in crickets and bushcrickets were obtained by Weever and Bray (1933) and gave an indication of the frequency range of the auditory responses. The biophysics of tympanal organs was analysed by Autrum (1941) and was related to a general theory of insect hearing. Roeder took his moth preparations to the field and demonstrated both the ultrasound sensitivity of moth ears and the afferent responses to sonar calls of hunting bats passing by (Roeder and Treat 1957). In 1961, the first recordings of thoracic auditory neurons in Tettigoniids were reported by Suga and Katsuki (1961) addressing frequency analysis, directional sensitivity and central inhibition. Questions about the higher central mechanisms of acoustic communication remained open for some time until Huber (1960) elicited singing behaviour in crickets by means of electrical brain stimulation and Roeder (1969) carried out the first recordings of auditory brain neurons in moths. Then developments were fast: The advent of neural tracing techniques and intracellular recordings in insects allowed such advances as a systematic study of auditory pathways at the level of identified neurons, their structure and response properties (e.g. Rehbein et al. 1974; Casaday and Hoy 1977; Wohlers and Huber 1978) and a cellular approach to the neuronal control of singing behaviour (Bentley 1969). The increase in the inventory of scientific tools over the last decades with advances in behavioural and neural recording methods, in microscopy, and in molecular and genetic methods now allows tackling fundamental problems of insect hearing and acoustic communication at all levels from ecology to molecular mechanisms. 1.1 Central Research Questions The variety of signalling behaviours and hearing organs makes insects highly suitable animals to explore and analyse signal generation and auditory processing. The fascinating progress that has been made is still related to a set of central questions characterising the focus of past, current and future research: How did hearing and acoustic communication behaviour evolve in insects and what is the neural and developmental origin of the auditory organs? What are the functional properties of hearing organs in respect of intensity, frequency and directional sensitivity and how are these achieved at a molecular, biophysical and neural level? How are hearing and sound production embedded in the natural lifestyle of the animals allowing intraspecific communication and also predator avoidance and even predation? How is phonotactic behaviour tuned to the communication signals of conspecifics? What are the neural mechanisms of peripheral and central auditory processing that allow the recognition of species-specific sounds and lead to adapted motor responses? What are the biophysical and neural mechanisms underlying signal generation? How are central pattern generators organised that drive the species-specific motor activity and how is their activity controlled by the brain? Finally: What is the genetic basis of acoustic communication behaviour that leads to species-specific signal generation and pattern recognition and even speciation? The subsequent chapters of this book will cover and address these questions to different degrees. The answers to these questions provide us with profound and fundamental understanding of a conspicuous and crucial insect behaviour. The final story will emerge by our ongoing research activity, closing again with Pumphrey (1940): “It will be obvious that much remains to be done”.

abstract = {Although monitoring social information is a key aspect of the social complexity hypothesis, surprisingly little work has compared social knowledge across different species of wild animals. In the present study, I use playback experiments to test for individual recognition in wild male geladas (Theropithecus gelada) to compare with published accounts of social knowledge in chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). Geladas and baboons are closely related primates living in socially complex groups that differ dramatically in group size-geladas routinely associate with more than 10 times the number of conspecifics than do baboons. Using grunts from non-rival males to simulate approaches, I examined the strength of a subject male's response when the 'approach' was from the direction of (i) non-rival males (control), or (ii) rival males (a more salient stimulus if playback grunts are not recognized by the subject). I compared responses separately based on the degree of social overlap between the caller and the subject. Responses indicate that male geladas, unlike baboons, do not use vocalizations to recognize all of the individuals they regularly encounter. This represents, to my knowledge, the first documented evidence of 'missing' social knowledge in a natural primate population. The sharp distinction between baboons and geladas suggests that geladas are either unable or unmotivated to keep track of the individual identity of other males in their multi-level society-even males with whom they have a large degree of social overlap. Thus, these results are consistent with the central assumption of the social complexity hypothesis that social cognition is costly. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

In this final contribution to the special issue, I look to the future and discuss ten questions in need of further work, touching on issues ranging from theoretical modeling and the evolution of behavior to molecular mechanisms and the development of behavior. In particular, I emphasize that the use of multimodal communication allows animals to switch between sensory channels when one channel becomes too noisy, and suggest that a better understanding of this process may help us both to understand the evolution of multisensory signaling and to predict the success of species facing environmental changes that affect signaling channels, such as urbanization and climate change. An expanded section is included on the effects of climate change on animal communication across sensory channels, urging researchers to pursue this topic due to the rapidity with which the environment is currently transforming. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {In mammals and birds, hippocampal processing is crucial for allocentric spatial learning. In these vertebrate groups, lesions to the hippocampal formation produce selective impairments in spatial tasks that require the encoding of relationships among environmental features, but not in tasks that require the approach to a single cue or simple non-spatial discriminations. In reptiles, a great deal of anatomical evidence indicates that the medial cortex (MC) could be homologous to the hippocampus of mammals and birds; however, few studies have examined the functional role of this structure in relation to learning and memory processes. The aim of this work was to study how the MC lesions affect spatial strategies. Results of Experiment 1 showed that the MC lesion impaired the performance in animals pre-operatively trained in a place task, and although these animals were able to learn the same task after surgery, probe test revealed that learning strategies used by MC lesioned turtles were different to that observed in sham animals. Experiment 2 showed that the MC lesion did not impair the retention of the pre-operatively learned task when a single intramaze visual cue identified the goal. These results suggest that the reptilian MC and hippocampus of mammals and birds function in quite similar ways, not only in relation to those spatial functions that are impaired, but also in relation to those learning processes that are not affected. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Environmental noise that reduces the probability that animals will detect communicative signals poses a special challenge for long-range communication. The application of signal-detection theory to animal communication lead to the prediction that signals directed at distant receivers in noisy environments will begin with conspicuous "alerting" components to attract the attention of receivers, before delivery of the information-rich portion of the signal. Whether animals actually adopt this strategy is not clear, despite suggestions that alerts might exist in a variety of taxa. By using a combination of behavioral observations and experimental manipulations with robotic lizard "playbacks," we show that free-living territorial Anolis lizards add an "alert" to visual displays when communicating to distant receivers in situations of poor visibility, and that these introductory alerts in turn enhance signal detection in adverse signaling conditions. Our results show that Anolis lizards are able to evaluate environmental conditions that affect the degradation of long-distance signals and adjust their behavior accordingly. This study demonstrates that free-living animals enhance the efficiency of long-range communication through the modulation of signal design and the facultative addition of an alert. Our findings confirm that alert signals are an important strategy for communicating in "noisy" conditions and suggest a reexamination of the existence of alerts in other animals relying on long-range communication. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Individual recognition (IR) behavior has been widely studied, uncovering spectacular recognition abilities across a range of taxa and modalities. Most studies of IR focus on the recognizer (receiver). These studies typically explore whether a species is capable of IR, the cues that are used for recognition and the specializations that receivers use to facilitate recognition. However, relatively little research has explored the other half of the communication equation: the individual being recognized (signaler). Provided there is a benefit to being accurately identified, signalers are expected to actively broadcast their identity with distinctive cues. Considering the prevalence of IR, there are probably widespread benefits associated with distinctiveness. As a result, selection for traits that reveal individual identity might represent an important and underappreciated selective force contributing to the evolution and maintenance of genetic polymorphisms.},

abstract = {Previous studies have posited the use of acoustics-based surveys to monitor population size and estimate their density. However, decreasing the bias in population estimations, such as by using Capture–Mark–Recapture, requires the identification of individuals using supervised classification methods, especially for sparsely populated species like the wolf which may otherwise be counted repeatedly. The cryptic behaviour of Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) poses serious challenges to survey efforts, and thus, there is no reliable estimate of their population despite a prominent role in the ecosystem. Like other wolves, Indian wolves produce howls that can be detected over distances of more than 6 km, making them ideal candidates for acoustic surveys. Here, we explore the use of a supervised classifier to identify unknown individuals. We trained a supervised Agglomerative Nesting hierarchical clustering (AGNES) model using 49 howls from five Indian wolves and achieved 98% individual identification accuracy. We tested our model's predictive power using 20 novel howls from a further four individuals (test dataset) and resulted in 75% accuracy in classifying howls to individuals. The model can reduce bias in population estimations using Capture-Mark-Recapture and track individual wolves non-invasively by their howls. This has potential for studies of wolves' territory use, pack composition, and reproductive behaviour. Our method can potentially be adapted for other species with individually distinctive vocalisations, representing an advanced tool for individual-level monitoring.},

abstract = {1. Acoustic communication requires not only detection of the signal but also discrimination of differences among signals by the receiver. Attenuation and degradation of acoustic signals during transmission through the atmosphere will impose limits on acoustic communication. Attenuation of sound during atmospheric transmission results primarily from atmospheric absorption, ground attenuation, scattering of a sound beam, and deflection of sound by stratified media. For maximum range of detection, therefore, animals should favor optimal positions in their habitat and optimal weather conditions. Frequency-dependent attenuation seems not to differ consistently among major classes of terrestrial habitats, such as forests and fields. Increased scattering of higher frequencies from vegetation in forests is in part matched by scattering from micrometerological heterogeneities in the open. 2. In addition to frequency-dependent attenuation, two kinds of degradation during atmospheric transmission will limit a receiver's ability to resolve differences among acoustic signals: the accumulation of irregular amplitude fluctuations from nonstationary heterogeneities, often atmospheric turbulence, and reverberation. Both types of degradation affect temporal patterns of amplitude or intensity modulation more than patterns of frequency modulation. Both effects should increase with carrier frequency, as they depend on the relationship between wavelength and the dimensions of scattering heterogeneities. Irregular amplitude fluctuations are more severe in open habitats and primarily mask low frequencies of amplitude modulation; reverberations are more severe in forested habitats and primarily mask high frequencies of amplitude modulation and rapid, repetitive frequency modulation. This difference between forested and open habitats could explain previous reports that birds in the undergrowth of tropical forests avoid rapid frequency modulation in their long-range vocalizations. 3. Maximum range of detection is probably not the primary selection pressure on many animal vocalizations, even for territorial advertisement, except perhaps in tropical forests. Instead, acoustic signals might incorporate features that degrade predictably with range to permit a receiver to estimate the signaler's distance. Future investigations might explore the propagation of animal vocalizations in relation to the usual spacing of animals in their habitat. Features that encode different kinds of information, such as individual and species identity, might propagate to different distances. 4. Measurements of the transmission of sound in natural environments have often not controlled several important parameters. First, the effects of gound attenuation and scattering are not linear with range; consequently measurements of excess attenuation over different ranges in the same environment might differ. Second, the directionality of speakers and microphones will affect measurements of attenuation and reverberations in scattering environments. Third, as stationary waves shift with frequency, any single microphone placement will lie in a null for some frequencies and in a maximum for others. {\textcopyright} 1978 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Twenty years ago, a new conceptual paradigm known as 'receiver psychology' was introduced to explain the evolution of animal communication systems. This paradigm advanced the idea that psychological processes in the receiver's nervous system influence a signal's detectability, discriminability and memorability, and thereby serve as powerful sources of selection shaping signal design. While advancing our understanding of signal diversity, more recent studies make clear that receiver psychology, as a paradigm, has been structured too narrowly and does not incorporate many of the perceptual and cognitive processes of signal reception that operate between sensory transduction and a receiver's response. Consequently, the past two decades of research on receiver psychology have emphasized considerations of signal evolution but failed to ask key questions about the mechanisms of signal reception and their evolution. The primary aim of this essay is to advocate for a broader receiver psychology paradigm that more explicitly includes a research focus on receivers' psychological landscapes. We review recent experimental studies of hearing and sound communication to illustrate how considerations of several general perceptual and cognitive processes will facilitate future research on animal signalling systems. We also emphasize how a rigorous comparative approach to receiver psychology is critical to explicating the full range of perceptual and cognitive processes involved in receiving and responding to signals. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Signal detection theory involves a level of abstraction unfamiliar in field studies of animal communication. Mastering its implications, however, leads to some strong predictions about the evolution of signals and responses and to some new procedures for investigating animal communication. A consequence of this approach to communication is the fundamental conclusion that a receiver cannot independently adjust its PCD and PFA. The only exception is the limiting case in which the output of a channel in the presence of a signal is perfectly distinct from the output in its absence, so PFA = 0. Otherwise, no matter how the criterion for response changes, any change in PCD is accompanied by a corresponding change in PFA. This compromise leads ultimately to a prediction that receivers evolve to optimize the net utility of their responses. The optimum might lie anywhere between extremes of gullibility or fastidiousness. In turn, signalers should evolve to balance the often incompatible advantages of increased detectability of signals, increased complexity of encoding, and restriction of signals to intended receivers. A second consequence of signal detection theory is the fundamental distinction between the detectability of a signal and the receiver's criterion for a response. Detectability depends on the contrast of the signal impinging on the subject and on the selectivity of the subject's perceptual channels. A receiver's criterion for response depends on its attitude toward the output of its perceptual channels, as a result of a decision to accept particular Pfa and Pcd. Because any receiver's responses to stimulation depend on both detectability of the stimulus and criterion for response, a definitive interpretation of responses requires attention to both. For a full interpretation of a receiver's performance, it is necessary to include null presentations in experiments in order to measure false alarms as well as correct detections. Signal detection theory thus suggests new ways to design and to interpret experiments that compare responses to stimulation. Although some practical difficulties face any application of signal detection theory to field studies, none seems insurmountable. With this approach, we stand to learn more about (1) the adaptations for communication in situations with high background stimulation, such as in choruses or complex social groups or at long range, (2) the effects of contrast, redundancy, reduced uncertainty, and familiarity on receivers' abilities to detect and discriminate signals, and (3) the evolution of exaggeration or dishonesty in signals as a consequence of the evolution of receivers' performance. In all of these ways, signal detection theory can advance our understanding of both the physiology and the evolution of communication. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most cooperative breeders live in discrete family groups, but in a minority, breeding populations comprise extended social networks of conspecifics that vary in relatedness. Selection for effective kin recognition may be expected for more related individuals in such kin neighbourhoods to maximize indirect fitness. Using a long-term social pedigree, molecular genetics, field observations and acoustic analyses, we examine how vocal similarity affects helping decisions in the long-tailed tit Aegithalos caudatus. Long-tailed tits are cooperative breeders in which help is typically redirected by males that have failed in their own breeding attempts towards the offspring of male relatives living within kin neighbourhoods. We identify a positive correlation between call similarity and kinship, suggesting that vocal cues offer a plausible mechanism for kin discrimination. Furthermore, we show that failed breeders choose to help males with calls more similar to their own. However, although helpers fine-tune their provisioning rates according to how closely related they are to recipients, their effort was not correlated with their vocal similarity to helped breeders. We conclude that although vocalizations are an important part of the recognition system of long-tailed tits, discrimination is likely to be based on prior association and may involve a combination of vocal and non-vocal cues.

The 6 adult female dispersers belonged to three mid‐ or low‐ranking matrilines in the parent clan. Two juvenile males returned to the parent clan for temporary visits, and three female members of one matriline rejoined the parent clan after absences of over 8 mo. Returning females, but not males, were targets of severe aggression by adult female residents of the parent clan, and by juvenile residents of both sexes. Returning females fell from their previous mid‐ranking positions to the bottom of the adult female hierarchy. Our data suggest that clan fission was promoted by the simultaneous occurrence of low food availability, an unusually high density of higher‐ranking conspecific competitors, and the availability of neighboring vacant habitat. 1993 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract = {Spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, are gregarious carnivores whose social lives share much in common with those of cercopithecine primates. We conducted playback experiments to determine whether free-living hyaenas are capable of identifying individual conspecifics on the basis of their long-distance vocalization, the 'whoop'. When prerecorded cub whoops were played to mothers and other breeding females (controls), mothers responded significantly more vigorously to whoops of their own cubs than did controls. We also tested the hypothesis that specific vocal recognition abilities are based on kinship in this species. Listeners that were related to the whooping cub responded more vigorously to recorded vocalizations than did unrelated individuals, with response intensity in some cases increasing directly with the size of the coefficient of relatedness (r). Our final goal was to determine whether control animals in these experiments can recognize third-party social relationships among other group members, an ability demonstrated by vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, in similar playback experiments conducted by earlier investigators. In contrast to vervets, control females in the present experiments were no more likely to look at the mother of the whooping cub than at other control females after playback. This suggests that hyaenas may accomplish many of the same social feats as do vervets without possessing the ability to recognize third-party relationships. If confirmed in other domains of hyaena social life, our findings have important implications regarding selection pressures favouring the evolution of intelligence.

Core areas containing breeding dens, lairs and water sources were scent‐marked with faeces (= latrines), anal gland deposits (= pasting) and interdigital gland deposits (scratch marks). Intergroup encounters and associated territorial behaviours described for East African hyaena populations were not observed in the Namib hyaena population.

abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops cf. aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia exhibit the most complex alliances known outside of humans. Advances in our understanding of these alliances have occurred with expansions of our study area each decade. In the 1980s, we discovered that males cooperated in stable trios and pairs (first-order alliances) to herd individual oestrous females, and that two such alliances of four to six, sometimes related, individuals (second-order alliances) cooperated against other males in contests over females. The 1990s saw the discovery of a large 14-member second-order alliance whose members exhibited labile first-order alliance formation among nonrelatives. Partner preferences as well as a relationship between first-order alliance stability and consortship rate in this 'super-alliance' indicated differentiated relationships. The contrast between the super-alliance and the 1980s alliances suggested two alliance tactics. An expansion of the study area in the 2000s revealed a continuum of second-order alliance sizes in an open social network and no simple relationship between second-order alliance size and alliance stability, but generalized the relationship between first-order alliance stability and consortship rate within second-order alliances. Association preferences and contests involving three second-order alliances indicated the presence of third-order alliances. Second-order alliances may persist for 20 years with stability thwarted by gradual attrition, but underlying flexibility is indicated by observations of individuals joining other alliances, including old males joining young or old second-order alliances. The dolphin research has informed us on the evolution of complex social relationships and large brain evolution in mammals and the ecology of alliance formation. Variation in odontocete brain size and the large radiation of delphinids into a range of habitats holds great promise that further effort to describe their societies will be rewarded with similar advances in our understanding of these important issues.},

abstract = {Dispersal has a significant impact on lifetime reproductive success, and is often more prevalent in one sex than the other. In group-living mammals, dispersal is normally male-biased and in theory this sexual bias could be a response by males to female mate preferences, competition for access to females or resources, or the result of males avoiding inbreeding. There is a lack of studies on social mammals that simultaneously assess these factors and measure the fitness consequences of male dispersal decisions. Here we show that male-biased dispersal in the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) most probably results from an adaptive response by males to simple female mate-choice rules that have evolved to avoid inbreeding. Microsatellite profiling revealed that females preferred sires that were born into or immigrated into the female's group after the female was born. Furthermore, young females preferred short-tenured sires and older females preferred longer-tenured sires. Males responded to these female mate preferences by initiating their reproductive careers in groups containing the highest number of young females. As a consequence, 11% of males started their reproductive career in their natal group and 89% of males dispersed. Males that started reproduction in groups containing the highest number of young females had a higher long-term reproductive success than males that did not. The female mate-choice rules ensured that females effectively avoided inbreeding without the need to discriminate directly against close kin or males born in their own group, or to favour immigrant males. The extent of male dispersal as a response to such female mate preferences depends on the demographic structure of breeding groups, rather than the genetic relatedness between females and males. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Long-term social memory is important, because it is an ecologically relevant test of cognitive capacity, it helps us understand which social relationships are remembered and it relates two seemingly disparate disciplines: cognition and sociality. For dolphins, long-term memory for conspecifics could help assess social threats as well as potential social or hunting alliances in a very fluid and complex fission-fusion social system, yet we have no idea how long dolphins can remember each other. Through a playback study conducted within a multi-institution dolphin breeding consortium (where animals are moved between different facilities), recognition of unfamiliar versus familiar signature whistles of former tank mates was assessed. This research shows that dolphins have the potential for lifelong memory for each other regardless of relatedness, sex or duration of association. This is, to my knowledge, the first study to show that social recognition can last for at least 20 years in a non-human species and the first large-scale study to address long-term memory in a cetacean. These results, paired with evidence from elephants and humans, provide suggestive evidence that sociality and cognition could be related, as a good memory is necessary in a fluid social system. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {The role of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics cannot be overestimated. By defining the probability measure on a set of the studied combinatorial objects various numerical characteristics of these objects can be considered as random variables and studied using the methods of probability theory. The advantage of this approach is the well-developed probabilistic analytic techniques that allow us in many cases to obtain results, the proof of which by other methods appears too complicated, if indeed it is at all possible. The application of probabilistic methods is connected with extensive use of the terminology of probability theory. The reader will easily understand however that one speaks in fact about solving enumerative problems of discrete analysis. One of the primary research lines is the study of the limit properties of combinatorial objects manifested at the unlimited increase of the number of elements comprising such objects. It is often possible to represent the distributions of the characteristics of combinatorial objects as conditional distributions of the sums of independent random variables so that they can be studied using asymptotic methods in probability theory, namely limit theorems for sums of independent random variables.},

abstract = {NATURE 435 ling, others frequently follow suit resulting in a confused overlay. However, at slow speeds the individual whistles can be isolated. During these whist.le sessions the individual contours were retained, and as they overlapped each other it was obvious that each animal was making its individual whistle. As our contours 4 and 5 varied only in the initial rise or fall of the warble, only the overlaid whistles of these two animals proved that they were distinctive and not variations of one contour. On the basis of these observations we do not intend to state arbitrarily that a single animal has a vocabulary of a single somewhat variable whistle contour. However, this distinctive whistle occupied much more than 90 per cent of the total whistle vocabulary of any one animal during this three-week period following capture. Very rarely, however, an unfamiliar whistle was recorded. We do wish to point out, however, that our work to this point indicates a definite tendency toward an individualized whistle. Further investigation of this point is contemplated in the immediate future. The whistle constitutes only ono of the many phonations emitted by T. truncatus. Squeals, chirps, squeaks, squawks, barks, yelps, grating sounds, and echo-location bursts are common ones. Although some of theso have been clearly shown to be used for e:iho-location•, others such as the squawk, even though containing very rapid pulses, may be indicative of the emotional state of the animal and not a'l echo-location device. Much work remains to be done in analysing these sounds in relation to behaviour.},

Unlike terrestrial mammals, delphinid sound production is driven by pressurized air within a complex nasal system. It is unclear how fundamental whistle contours can be maintained across a large range of hydrostatic pressures and air sac volumes. Two opposing hypotheses propose that tonal sounds arise either from tissue vibrations or through actual whistle production from vortices stabilized by resonating nasal air volumes. Here, we use a trained bottlenose dolphin whistling in air and in heliox to test these hypotheses. The fundamental frequency contours of stereotyped whistles were unaffected by the higher sound speed in heliox. Therefore, the term whistle is a functional misnomer as dolphins actually do not whistle, but form the fundamental frequency contour of their tonal calls by pneumatically induced tissue vibrations analogous to the operation of vocal folds in terrestrial mammals and the syrinx in birds. This form of tonal sound production by nasal tissue vibrations has probably evolved in delphinids to enable impedance matching to the water, and to maintain tonal signature contours across changes in hydrostatic pressures, air density and relative nasal air volumes during dives.{\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Variation in communicative complexity has been conceptually and empirically attributed to social complexity, with animals living in more complex social environments exhibiting more signals and/or more complex signals than animals living in simpler social environments. As compelling as studies highlighting a link between social and communicative variables are, this hypothesis remains challenged by operational problems, contrasting results, and several weaknesses of the associated tests. Specifically, how to best operationalize social and communicative complexity remains debated; alternative hypotheses, such as the role of a species' ecology, morphology, or phylogenetic history, have been neglected; and the actual ways in which variation in signaling is directly affected by social factors remain largely unexplored. In this review, we address these three issues and propose an extension of the ``social complexity hypothesis for communicative complexity'' that resolves and acknowledges the above factors. We specifically argue for integrating the inherently multimodal nature of communication into a more comprehensive framework and for acknowledging the social context of derived signals and the potential of audience effects. By doing so, we believe it will be possible to generate more accurate predictions about which specific social parameters may be responsible for selection on new or more complex signals, as well as to uncover potential adaptive functions that are not necessarily apparent from studying communication in only one modality.},

abstract = {Spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) live in social groups that exhibit high levels of fission-fusion dynamics, in which group members form subgroups of varying sizes and compositions. Within these fluid societies, how individuals establish contact with dispersed group members with whom they might choose to associate remains unclear. Long-range vocalizations might facilitate interactions between group members and provide a means of social coordination in fission-fusion societies. We evaluated this possibility for one spider monkey vocalization, the loud call, by examining calling behavior, the relationship between loud calls and changes in subgroup size, and the response of individuals to distant calls and playback experiments in a single study group. We found that 82 % of loud calls were emitted within 30 min of a call from a different location, suggesting that individuals frequently emit loud calls in response to the calls of distant group members. Subgroups that emitted loud calls, especially those that responded to distant calls, were much more likely to experience an increase in subgroup size within an hour after calling than those that did not. Animals also approached distant loud calls more than they avoided or ignored these calls. Finally, playbacks of male calls demonstrated that females respond preferentially to the calls of some individuals over others. Taken together, these results provide support for the hypothesis that spider monkey loud calls function to facilitate and initiate interactions between dispersed group members and suggest that vocal signals can play an important role in influencing social interactions in fission-fusion societies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Communication in noise differs in a fundamental way from communication without noise, because a receiver faces four possible outcomes every time it checks its input. These outcomes present inevitable trade-offs for a receiver in adjusting its threshold for response. A signaler also faces trade-offs, in this case between costs and benefits as the exaggeration of signals increases. Furthermore, a receiver's and signaler's performances are mutually interdependent. The utility of a receiver's threshold depends on the signaler's exaggeration (the level of the signal in relation to the level of noise), and the utility of a signaler's exaggeration depends on the receiver's threshold. Diminishing returns for both receiver and signaler suggest the possibility of a joint evolutionary equilibrium for a receiver's threshold and a signaler's exaggeration. The present analysis combines previous expressions for the utility of a receiver's threshold (U r ) and the utility of a signaler's exaggeration (U s ) in order to explore the possibility of this joint equilibrium. Utilities for both parties are expressed as survival × fecundity, an approximate measure of the spread of genes associated with a phenotype. Thus, U r and U s , as functions of both the receiver's threshold (t) and the signaler's exaggeration (e), represent the adaptive landscapes for each party, and the reciprocal partial derivatives of these utilities, $\delta$U r /$\delta$ e and $\delta$U s /$\delta$ t , approximate the selection gradients for the receiver's threshold and the signaler's exaggeration. With parameters for both the receiver's and the signaler's performances set to plausible values for many cases of mate choice, the resulting analysis shows that there exists a joint optimum for the receiver's threshold and the signaler's exaggeration. This optimum is a Nash equilibrium at which neither party can do better by a unilateral change in behavior. In some conditions, the equilibrium for communication in mate choice occurs at a higher threshold and higher exaggeration than the equilibrium for communication with warning signals. In general, these results indicate that the normal situation for communication in noise is honesty with deception. honesty on average but with instances of disadvantageous outcomes for receivers or signalers. Furthermore, the relationship between honesty and costs is more complex than currently recognized. Most important, the joint optimum for receiver and signaler indicates that communication in noise cannot escape the problems created by noise. Noise is an inevitable component of communication, and perfection in communication is not expected in natural conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

When applied to probability mass function (PMF), entropy can also be used to measure the "peakiness" of a distribution. In this paper, we propose using the entropy of short time Fourier transform spectrum, normalised as PMF, as an additional feature for automatic speech recognition (ASR). It is indeed expected that a peaky spectrum, representation of clear formant structure in the case of voiced sounds, will have low entropy, while a flatter spectrum corresponding to nonspeech or noisy regions will have higher entropy. Extending this reasoning further, we introduce the idea of multiband/multi-resolution entropy feature where we divide the spectrum into equal size sub-bands and compute entropy in each sub-band. The results presented in this paper show that multi-band entropy features used in conjunction with normal cepstral features improve the performance of ASR system.},

abstract = {The most common vocalization of the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, is the rumble, but there is no consensus as to how many rumble subtypes exist. From the standpoint of social function, many types of rumble have been proposed. From a structural standpoint, however, few studies have examined detailed acoustic measurements of a large number of calls. We analysed 270 rumbles from six adult female African elephants housed at Disney's Animal Kingdom (Lake Buena Vista, Florida, U.S.A.). Subjects wore collars outfitted with microphones and radiotransmitters that allowed recording of vocalizations from identified individuals. Rumble vocalizations were digitized and both source and filter features were measured for each call. Behavioural and endocrine data were collected so that acoustical data could be placed into the context of ongoing social behaviour and reproductive state. Multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that, from a structural standpoint, rumbles from this captive setting could not be divided into distinct subtypes, but there was extensive acoustic variation across rumbles. Discriminant function analysis and MANOVA were employed to further explore this variation. First, acoustic characteristics varied according to the individual identity of the caller. Second, rumbles varied as a function of negative emotional arousal. When associating with dominant animals, subordinate females produced rumbles with lower cepstral coefficients, suggesting low tonality and unstable pitch in the voice, compared to rumbles produced outside of the presence of dominant animals. Rumbles as a whole did not cluster into distinct acoustic types, but structural variation in rumbles reflected the individual identity and emotional state of callers. ?? 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Large carnivore populations are declining worldwide due to direct and indirect conflicts with humans. Protected areas are critical for conserving large carnivores, but increasing human-wildlife conflict, tourism, and human population growth near these sanctuaries may have negative effects on the carnivores within sanctuary borders. Our goals were to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance along the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, influences the demography and space-use of two large carnivore species that engage in intense interspecific competition. Here we document, in one disturbed region of the Reserve, a rapid increase in the population size of one large predator, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), but a striking concurrent decline in numbers of another, the African lion (Panthera leo). Anthropogenic disturbances negatively affected lion populations, and decreasing lion numbers appear to have a positive effect on hyena populations, indicated here by an increase in juvenile survivorship. We also saw an increase in the number of livestock consumed by hyenas. Our results suggest human population growth and indirect effects of human activity along Reserve boundaries may be effecting a trophic cascade inside the Reserve itself. These results indicate both top-down and bottom-up processes are causing a shift in the carnivore community, and a major disruption of guild structure, inside the boundaries of one of the most spectacular protected areas in Africa.},

abstract = {Social hierarchies are widespread in human and animal societies, and an individual's position in its hierarchy affects both its access to resources and its fitness. Hierarchies are traditionally thought of in terms of variation in individual ability to win fights, but many are structured around arbitrary conventions like nepotistic inheritance rather than such traits as physical strength or weapon size. These convention-based societies are perplexing because position in the hierarchy appears to be gained irrespective of individual physical ability, yet social status strongly affects access to resources and fitness. It remains unclear why individuals abide by seemingly arbitrary conventions regarding social status when they stand to benefit by ignoring these conventions and competing for top positions or access to resources. Using data from wild spotted hyenas collected over 27 y and five generations, we show that individuals who repeatedly form coalitions with their top allies are likely to improve their position in the hierarchy, suggesting that social alliances facilitate revolutionary social change. Using lifetime reproductive success as a fitness measure, we go on to demonstrate that these status changes can have major fitness consequences. Finally, we show that the consequences of these changes may become even more dramatic over multiple generations, as small differences in social rank become amplified over time. This work represents a first step in reconciling the advantages of high status with the appearance of “arbitrary” conventions that structure inequality in animal and human societies.},

abstract = {Research on acoustic communication has often focused on signalling between territorial individuals or static neighbouring groups. Under these circumstances, receivers have the opportunity to learn to recognize the signals only of the limited number of conspecifics with which they are in auditory contact. In some mammals, however, social units move freely with respect to one another and range widely, providing individuals with opportunities to learn to recognize the signals of a wide range of conspecifics in addition to those of their immediate neighbours. We conducted playback experiments on African elephants, Loxodonta africana, in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, to determine the extent to which adult female elephants, which have a highly fluid social system, can recognize others in the population through infrasonic contact calls. Female elephants could distinguish the calls of female family and bond group members from those of females outside of these categories; moreover, they could also discriminate between the calls of family units further removed than bond group members, on the basis of how frequently they encountered them. We estimated that subjects would have to be familiar with the contact calls of a mean of 14 families in the population (containing around 100 adult females in total), in order to perform these discriminations. Female elephants thus appear to have unusually extensive networks of vocal recognition, which may prove to be typical of long-lived species that have both fluid social systems and the means for long-distance vocal communication.

abstract = {Previous research has shown that African lions (Panthera leo) have the ability to discriminate between conspecific vocalisations, but little is known about how individual identity is conveyed in the spectral structure of roars. Using acoustic–accelerometer biologgers that allow vocalisations to be reliably associated with individual identity, we test for vocal individuality in the fundamental frequency (f0) of roars from 5 male lions, firstly by comparing simple f0 summary features and secondly by modelling the temporal pattern of the f0 contour. We then assess the application of this method for discriminating between individuals using passive acoustic monitoring. Results indicate that f0 summary features only allow for vocal discrimination with 70.7% accuracy. By comparison, vocal discrimination can be achieved with an accuracy of 91.5% based on individual differences in the temporal pattern of the f0 sequence. We further demonstrate that passively recorded lion roars can be localised and differentiated with similar accuracy. The existence of individually unique f0 contours in lion roars and their relatively lower attenuation indicates a likely mechanism enabling individual lions to identify conspecifics over long distances. These differences can be exploited by researchers to track individuals across the landscape and thereby supplement conventional lion monitoring approaches.},

abstract = {A quantitative acoustic malysis of long calls of red-chested moustached tamarins (Suguznus 1. lubiurus) was undertaken after capture in the primary forest of Northwestern Bolivia, comparing two populations. Two acoustic parameters are statistically significantly different. Acoustic properties distinguishing individual heterogeneity are quite consistent between the groups and completely different from cues separating population variability. As these two study groups were only 27 km apart when trapped, and as no geographical barriers prevented genetic exchanges between them, we assume populational vocal variability comparable to dialects in birds. Populational differences of vocalizations have been described and studied most intensively in birds and have significance for diverse topics such as specia-tion, learning and social communication. The pioneering studies of THORPE (1958) and MARLER (1970) give a picture of bird song development combining genetic and learning components. However, vocal variants found so far, correlating with different nonhuman primate populations (e.g. squirrel monkeys, WINTER 1969; saddle-back tamarins, HODUN et al. 1981 ; ruffed lemurs, MACEDONIA & TAYLOR 1985), are subspecific variations, suggesting underlying genetic differences. Results have given little evidence of early learning and stressed genetic mechan-isms. Observations of interspecific hybrids (e.g. squirrel monkeys, NEWMAN & SYMMES 1982; gibbons, BROCKELMAN & SCHILLING 1984), and isolation experi-ments (e.g. chimpanzees, KELLOG 1968; squirrel monkeys, WINTER et al. 1973) support this assumption. Only GREEN (1 975) provided suggestive evidence of dialects among different populations of Japanese monkeys (Macucu fttscata fuscata).

abstract = {Underwater vocalizations were recorded during repeated encounters with 16 pods, or stable kin groups, of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) off the coast of British Columbia. Pods were identified from unique natural markings on individuals. Vocal exchanges within pods were dominated by repetitious, discrete calls. Pods each produced 7-17 (mean 10.7) types of discrete calls. Individuals appear to acquire their pod's call repertoire by learning, and repertoires can persist with little change for over 25 years. Call repertoires differed significantly among pods in the resident population. The 16 pods formed four distinct acoustic associations, or clans, each having a unique repertoire of discrete calls, or vocal tradition. Pods within a clan shared several call types, but no sharing took place among clans. Shared calls often contained structural variations specific to each pod or group of pods in the clan. These variants and other differences in acoustic behaviour formed a system of related pod-specific dialects within the vocal tradition of each clan. Pods from different clans often travelled together, but observed patterns of social associations were often independent of acoustic relationships. It is proposed that each clan comprises related pods that have descended from a common ancestral group. New pods formed from this ancestral group through growth and matrilineal division of the lineage. The formation of new pods was accompanied by divergence of the call repertoire of the founding group. Such divergence resulted from the accumulation of errors in call learning across generations, call innovation, and call extinction. Pod-specific repertoires probably serve to enhance the efficiency of vocal communication within the group and act as behavioural indicators of pod affiliation. The striking differences among the vocal traditions of different clans suggest that each is an independent matriline},

abstract = {This study on common marmosets Callithrix jacchus is the first to examine noise-dependent mechanisms of vocal plasticity in a New World monkey. Since acoustic communication can be considerably impaired by environmental noise, some animals have evolved adaptations to counteract its masking effects. The studied marmosets increased the sound level of their spontaneous calls in response to increased levels of white noise broadcast to them. Possibly, such noise-dependent adjustment of vocal amplitude serves to maintain a specific signal-to-noise ratio that is favourable for signal production. Concurrently, the adjustment of vocal amplitude can maintain a given active space for communication. In contrast to some bird species, no noise-induced increase in the number of syllables per call series could be found, showing that an increased serial redundancy of vocal signals was not used to communicate under noisy conditions. Finally, we examined a possible noise-dependent prolongation of vocal signals. This approach was guided by the findings of perceptional studies, which suggest an increased detection probability of prolonged signals in noise by temporal summation. Marmosets indeed increased the duration of their call syllables along with increasing background noise levels. This is the first evidence of such mechanism of vocal plasticity in an animal communication system.},

The present experiments attempt to ( I) estimate listeners' capabilities in this area and (2) assess the importance of the auditors being acquainted with the talkers. Speakers were I 0 adult males who recorded speech samples under three types of speaking conditions: (a) normal, (b) stress and (c) disguise. Three classes of listeners were utilized: (a) a group of individuals who knew the talkers, (b) a group that did not know the talkers but were trained to identify them and (c) a group that neither knew the talkers nor understood the language spoken. The analyses indicate that the performances among the groups were significantly different. Listeners who knew the talkers performed best while the nonEnglish speaking listeners produced the lowest level of correct identification. The "middle" group, i.e. the English speaking listeners who did not know the talkers, was divided into two subgroups by the method of extremes. However, even in this case, the most competent of the subgroups still was significantly less able to identify the talkers than were the listeners who knew them; the least competent subgroup performed at about the same level as the auditors that did not speak English. Finally, analysis of the three types of speech revealed that the normal and stress conditions were not statistically different relative to the identification task whereas the disguised productions produced fewer correct identifications.},

abstract = {Unlike individually distinctive contact calls, or calls that aid in the recognition of young by their parents, the function or functions of individually distinctive alarm calls is less obvious. We conducted three experiments to study the importance of caller reliability in explaining individual- discriminative abilities in the alarm calls of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). In our first two experiments, we found that calls from less reliable individuals and calls from individuals calling from a greater simulated distance were more evocative than calls from reliable individuals or nearby callers. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that marmots assess the reliability of callers to help them decide how much time to allocate to independent vigilance. The third experiment demonstrated that the number of callers influenced responsiveness, probably because situations where more than a single caller calls, are those when there is certain to be a predator present. Taken together, the results from all three experiments demonstrate the importance of reliability in explaining individual discrimination abilities in yellow-bellied marmots. Marmots' assessment of reliability acts by influencing the time allocated to individual assessment and thus the time not allocated to other activities. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Many aspects of behaviour depend on recognition, but accurate recognition is difficult because the traits used for recognition often overlap. For example, brood parasitic birds mimic host eggs, so it is challenging for hosts to discriminate between their own eggs and parasitic eggs. Complex signals that occur in multiple sensory modalities or involve multiple signal components are thought to facilitate accurate recognition. However, we lack models that explore the effect of complex signals on the evolution of recognition systems. Here, we use individual-based models with a genetic algorithm to test how complex signals influence recognition thresholds, signaller phenotypes and receiver responses. The model has three main results. First, complex signals lead to more accurate recognition than simple signals. Second, when two signals provide different amounts of information, receivers will rely on the more informative signal to make recognition decisions and may ignore the less informative signal. As a result, the particular traits used for recognition change over evolutionary time as sender and receiver phenotypes evolve. Third, complex signals are more likely to evolve when recognition errors are high cost than when errors are low cost. Overall, redundant, complex signals are an evolutionarily stable mechanism to reduce recognition errors.

abstract = {Calls that catalyse group defence, as in the mobbing of predators, appear to facilitate cooperation by recruiting receivers to act collectively. However, even when such signals reliably precede cooperative behaviour, the extent to which the calls function as recruitment signals is unclear. Calls might simply arouse listeners' attention, setting off a cascade of independent responses to the threat. By contrast, they might convey information, for example, about signaller identity and the nature of a threat that affects receivers' decisions to participate. We explored this distinction by investigating a possible long-distance recruitment call used by spotted hyaenas. These social carnivores live in fission-fusion clans and individuals disperse widely within their territories. Putative recruitment calls must therefore attract receivers that are distant from the inciting threat and free to opt out of risky collective aggression. Hyaenas compete with lions over food, and neighbouring clans sometimes engage in violent border clashes. These high-stakes contests are decided based on numerical asymmetries, so hyaenas can only protect critical resources if the dispersed clan can converge quickly at conflict sites. We recorded and analysed whoop bouts produced in multiple contexts and found that bouts produced in response to signs of lion-hyaena conflict had shorter inter-whoop intervals than spontaneous 'display' bouts. In subsequent field playback experiments, resting hyaenas were significantly more likely to move in response to 'recruitment' bouts with shortened intervals than to otherwise identical 'display' bouts. Whereas only stimulus type predicted movement, lower-ranked subjects responded most quickly, perhaps because their feeding opportunities depend on arriving early at any kill site. Results demonstrate that hyaenas possess a signal that can reliably recruit allies across long distances, despite moderating effects of individual circumstances on the strength of receivers' responses.},

@article{Candiotti2012,
abstract = {Individually distinct vocalizations are widespread among social animals, presumably caused by variation in vocal tract anatomy. A less-explored source of individual variation is due to learned movement patterns of the vocal tract, which can lead to vocal convergence or divergence in social groups. We studied patterns of acoustic similarity in a social call produced by 14 female Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) in two free-ranging groups. Calls showed variability in fundamental frequency contours owing to individual identity and external context. Vocal divergence increased significantly between females during poor visibility and tended to increase in the presence of neighbours. In contrast, vocal convergence increased significantly between females during vocal interactions, because females matched the frequency contour of their own call with another female's preceding call. Our findings demonstrate that these primates have some control over the acoustic fine structure of their most important social vocalization. Vocal convergence and divergence are two opposing processes that enable callers to ensure spatial proximity and social cohesion with other group members.},
